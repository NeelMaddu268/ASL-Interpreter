# ðŸ¤Ÿ Real-Time ASL Sign Language Interpreter

A real-time ASL (American Sign Language) letter recognition system built using **MediaPipe**, **Scikit-Learn**, and **Streamlit**.

The app detects hand gestures from webcam input, classifies them into ASL letters, and optionally speaks them out loud using Text-to-Speech (TTS).
